# **PROJECT OVERVIEW**
The rapid growth of social media has made it easier for people to express their opinions online. While this connectivity has many benefits, it has also led to the widespread dissemination of **hate speech and offensive language**, which can negatively impact individuals, communities, and society at large.

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system to automatically detect hate speech, offensive language, and neutral content in social media text. By classifying text accurately, the system can help social media platforms, organizations, and researchers identify harmful content, improve online safety, and gain insights into trends in online discourse.

The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. It also considers challenges such as imbalanced classes, short and informal text, and nuanced language use.
